# Review App Workshop

For my "mobile" course: learning React Native.

Small review app in React Native which is intended to show different navigations and adding a form with Formik, using Yup for validation.

## Requirements

- node.js
- Either a smartphone with the `Expo Go` app or an Android/iOS emulator

To run the app:

1. Clone the GitHub repo
1. `npm install`
1. `npx expo start`
